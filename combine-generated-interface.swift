You initialize the future with a closure that takes a ``Combine/Future/Promise``; the closure calls the promise with a <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Result> that indicates either success or failure. In the success case, the future's downstream subscriber receives the element prior to the publishing stream finishing normally. If the result is an error, publishing terminates with that error.
///
/// The following example shows a method that uses a future to asynchronously publish a random number after a brief delay:
///
///     func generateAsyncRandomNumberFromFuture() -> Future <Int, Never> {
///         return Future() { promise in
///             DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
///                 let number = Int.random(in: 1...10)
///                 promise(Result.success(number))
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// To receive the published value, you use any Combine subscriber, such as a ``Combine/Subscribers/Sink``, like this:
///
///     cancellable = generateAsyncRandomNumberFromFuture()
///         .sink { number in print("Got random number \(number).") }
///
/// ### Integrating with Swift Concurrency
///
/// To integrate with the `async`-`await` syntax in Swift 5.5, `Future` can provide its value to an awaiting caller. This is particularly useful because unlike other types that conform to ``Publisher`` and potentially publish many elements, a `Future` only publishes one element (or fails). By using the ``Combine/Future/value-9iwjz`` property, the above call point looks like this:
///
///     let number = await generateAsyncRandomNumberFromFuture().value
///     print("Got random number \(number).")
///
/// ### Alternatives to Futures
///
/// The `async`-`await` syntax in Swift can also replace the use of a future entirely, for the case where you want to perform some operation after an asynchronous task completes.
///
/// You do this with the function <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/3814988-withCheckedContinuation> and its throwing equivalent, <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/3814989-withCheckedThrowingContinuation>. The following example performs the same asynchronous random number generation as the `Future` example above, but as an `async` method:
///
///     func generateAsyncRandomNumberFromContinuation() async -> Int {
///         return await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
///             DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
///                 let number = Int.random(in: 1...10)
///                 continuation.resume(returning: number)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The call point for this method doesn't use a closure like the future's sink subscriber does; it simply awaits and assigns the result:
///
///     let asyncRandom = await generateAsyncRandomNumberFromContinuation()
///
/// For more information on continuations, see the <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swift/swift_standard_library/concurrency> topic in the Swift standard library.

/// uses a ``Combine/Subscriber`` to request elements from a publisher, while Swift
/// concurrency uses the `for`-`await`-`in` syntax to iterate over elements
/// published by an `AsyncSequence`. Both APIs offer methods to modify the sequence
/// by mapping or filtering elements, while only Combine provides time-based
/// operations like
/// ``Publisher/debounce(for:scheduler:options:)`` and
/// ``Publisher/throttle(for:scheduler:latest:)``, and combining operations like
/// ``Publisher/merge(with:)-7fk3a`` and ``Publisher/combineLatest(_:_:)-1n30g``.
/// To bridge the two approaches, the property ``Publisher/values-1dm9r`` exposes
/// a publisher's elements as an `AsyncSequence`, allowing you to iterate over
/// them with `for`-`await`-`in` rather than attaching a ``Subscriber``.
///
/// # Creating Your Own Publishers
///
/// Rather than implementing the `Publisher` protocol yourself, you can create your own publisher by using one of several types provided by the Combine framework:
///
/// - Use a concrete subclass of ``Subject``, such as ``PassthroughSubject``, to publish values on-demand by calling its ``Subject/send(_:)`` method.
/// - Use a ``CurrentValueSubject`` to publish whenever you update the subject’s underlying value.
/// - Add the `@Published` annotation to a property of one of your own types. In doing so, the property gains a publisher that emits an event whenever the property’s value changes. See the ``Published`` type for an example of this approach.
